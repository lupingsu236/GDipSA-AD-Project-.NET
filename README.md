# GDipSA Application Development(AD) Project - .Net
.NET application (MRT4You) prototype developed by my team for NUS-ISS GDipSA course's Application Development (AD) Project. The AD Project consists of this .NET application to be used by MRT train operators and an Android mobile application for public users (see https://github.com/lupingsu236/GDipSA-AD-Project-Android).

## Project Specifications / Requirements 
For the Application Development(AD) project, teams were to build an integrated solution consisting of a web application and mobile application based on a chosen problem statement. 
Our team's proposed MRT Journey Planner Application (titled MRT4You) aims to tackle the problem of inconvenience caused by train disruptions to Singapore residents by sending real-time alerts. 
The proposed application allows train operator staff to log train disruptions via the web application, and such information will be pushed as notifications to public users of the mobile application. 
The MRT shortest route algorithm on the mobile app also considers the real-time situation, such as any breakdown or delay.

The main features for the web app include: 
1. View current status of rail line / stations 
2. Update status of train stations 
3. Analyse history of train disruptions 

The main features for the mobile app include: 
1. Search for shortest route 
2. Save frequent routes
3. Receive real-time notifications and updates on train disruptions
4. View most updated rail system map 

## My Contributions to the Project
My work for the project is focused on the mobile app (https://github.com/lupingsu236/GDipSA-AD-Project-Android). The web app was built by my teammates while I assisted in testing.
